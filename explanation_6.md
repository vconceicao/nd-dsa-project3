# Problem 6:  Unsorted Integer Array
### Explanation
### Design Decisions:
To find the max and min number in a array, it's necessary to create variables with maximum and minimum int values respectively
and at the first iteration the variables values will change to the first element of the array. As the algorithm continue to proccess the array, it will find the maximum and minimum value. 

### Time Complexity:
This solution runs in linear time **O(n)**, as it have to iterate over the entire array to find max and min. 

### Space Complexity:
The Space Complexity takes constant time  **O(1)**.
