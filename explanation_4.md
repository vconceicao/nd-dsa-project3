# Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem
### Explanation
### Design Decisions:
In this problem I've decided to track the numbers **0's** and **2's** as traversing the array and putting them into the correct places following the sort order, as the process go through,  the numbers 1's were automatically sorted as well. 

### Time Complexity:
This is variation of sort algorigthm that does **O(n)** comparisons.

### Space Complexity:
The Space Complexity takes constant time  **O(1)** as we are not creating any arrays through the single traversal.
